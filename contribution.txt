improvement idea: One way to improve projects on GitHub is by enhancing documentation.
 Many great projects suffer from poor or incomplete documentation,
 making it hard for new contributors to get involved.


How to improve documentation:
Clear README – Include installation steps, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.


Detailed Wiki or Docs – Use GitHub Pages or a separate docs/ folder for extended documentation.
